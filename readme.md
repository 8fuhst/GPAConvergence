This is a simple script that plots the entered grades into a Graph, and also draws the line to which the GPA (Grade Point Average) converges. The grades must currently be entered into the tool as a dict-entry within the source code, in the Format: ('Modulename': Grade, Amount of Credits).

#### TODO ####
In the future I'll hopefully have the time to build a simple GUI for this tool. Alternatively, I plan to build an Android Version (which would be my first) of this tool.
